## Sources and Help  
This game is vibe coded, lol.  
NAH ofc not, when I say vibe coded I mean that it's written in Python which is very much like English, right? Thus â€” *"vibe coded"*.

## AI help
Although I did use ChatGPT and Gemini to help me with things like:  
- "Is there any lib for this, this, and this?"  
- "How should I add projects to Git?"  
- Blah blah blah...
-The Logo is AI generated thou
